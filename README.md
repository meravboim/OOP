# Object Oriented Project

# Overview:
This project develops geographic data collection system. <br /> 
The system interpret the data and present the information with graphic tools.

# General Description
 The program is divided into three parts: <br />
 ### part 1: <br /> 
The program reads csv files from the aplication *wiglewifi*,the files contains Scan of WIFI spot that were sampled.<br />
The program sort each time period and location its points by its signal, and takes the 10 most strongest.Then it create a new CSV file  which each row  represent one Scan (the wifi spots with the same time and location) with the most 10 WIFI points with its information.
 <br />
 ### part 2: <br /> 
The program reads a csv file (that we write in part 1) and filter the data by time,place or id. <br />
*Time:* The program take the Scan that were taken during the defined time.<br />
*Place:* The program take the Scan which it location is in the given radius.<br />
*Id:* The program take the Scanwith the given id.<br />
The program take the filtered data and exports a kml file. <br />
 ### part 3: <br /> 
 The third part contains two algorithm which get as input Scans and revaluate the location of every Scan by some Data we get.<br />
 The program exports a csv file with the scan and the revaluated location. <br />
